# anonymous-auth-provider

## Features

 > note that `User` below is replaced with the typeName provided when configuring this package

### Interfaces

```graphql
interface AnonymousUser {
  secret: String
  isVerified: Boolean!
}
```

### Mutations

```graphql
authenticateAnonymousUser(secret: String!): authenticateAnonymousUserPayload

type authenticateAnonymousUserPayload {
  token: String!
}
```

## Installation

### Setup in Graphcool

Perform the following mutation in the system api

```graphql
mutation {
	installPackageV1()
}
```

dm @sorenbs in slack to have this activated. Include the following meta information:

 - ProjectId
 - Name of user model. Often this is `User`
 - facebook app id.
 
## Permissions

You should remove all Create User permissions. This ensures that users cannot be created manually and the `facebook-auth-provider` package will be able to create users anyway.

## Authentication flow in app

1. The user clicks authenticate with Facebook
2. Your app loads the Facebook ui to authenticate
3. Your app receives a Facebook Access Token
4. Your app calls the Graphcool mutation authenticateFacebookUser(fbToken: String!): {token: String!}
5. If the user doesnâ€™t exist a new User will be created
6. Graphcool returns a valid token for the user
7. Your app stores the token and uses this for all further requests to Graphcool

## Merging accounts

> note: this is not supported yet

This package supports merging users created with different Auth Providers as long as the email mataches.

Here is a typical example:

1. A user signs up with the email/password based simple-auth-provider
2. The user verifies her email
3. At some later point the user signs in using Facebook

At this point `facebook-auth-provider` will try to merge the two accounts. Merging succeeds if:

 - The users primary email in Facebook matches the email stored in Graphcool
 - The user in Graphcool has verified the email.
 
Account merging is supported by all official Authentication Providers:

 - `facebook-auth-provider`
 - `google-auth-provider`
 - `simple-auth-provider`
 - `auth0-auth-provider`

Merging accounts with different emails is currently not supported
